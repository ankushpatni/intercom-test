Proudest Achievement : 
I am going to talk about my experience when I joined my current company Medlife (E-Pharmacy).
I take care of the Supply Chain system in Medlife. When I joined there was a single Monolithic application. And because of this, there were many issues like the system was tightly coupled, maintainability, deployment, and autoscaling, etc.After understanding the system for 2 months I decided to break the Supply Chain system into Microservices architecture. And with this, I was able to break the monolithic application into small pieces that were useful for My team. And one of the components that I build is getting used as a product by other companies.
